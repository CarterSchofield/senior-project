# Documentation for `db.js`

The file `db.js` is a crucial part of the backend, specifically designed for setting up and managing the MongoDB database connection for the application. Below, we detail the components and functionality provided in this script.

## Overview

The `db.js` file handles the connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, a popular MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. The file sets up the MongoDB connection using a connection string and configures Mongoose to use native promises.

## All Database Models

- [Customer Model](./customerModelDoc.md)
- [Business Model](./businessModelDoc.md)
- [Review Model](./reviewModelDoc.md)
- [User Model](./userModelDoc.md)

## Dependencies

The script utilizes the `mongoose` npm package to facilitate interaction with MongoDB. Here is a breakdown of the dependency:

- **mongoose:** A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

## Configuration

The MongoDB connection URI is stored in the variable `mongoDB_URL`. This URI contains the credentials and the database path required to connect to the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

```javascript
const mongoDB_URL = mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@CLUSTER_URL/DATABASE_NAME?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Note:** It is generally not advisable to hard-code sensitive information such as database credentials directly in the source code. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for production environments.

## Database Connection Function

The `connect` function is an asynchronous function designed to establish the database connection using Mongoose. Here is a detailed look at its functionality:

- **Connection Setup:** Initializes the connection to MongoDB using the `mongoDB_URL`.
- **Event Handling:**
  - `error` event: Logs a message if the database connection could not be established.
  - `open` event: Logs a success message once the connection is successfully established.

```javascript
const connect = async () => {
    mongoose.connect(mongoDB_URL);
    const db = mongoose.connection;
    db.on("error", () => {
        console.log("could not connect");
    });
    db.once("open", () => {
        console.log("> Successfully connected to database");
    });
};
```

## Exported Modules

The `db.js` file exports the `connect` function, making it available for use in other parts of the application. This modular approach helps in maintaining the database connection setup separately from other parts of the application, promoting better organization and scalability.

```javascript
module.exports = { connect };
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `db.js` file, detailing the setup and management of the MongoDB database connection using Mongoose. It is essential for developers working on the application to understand the configuration and functionality offered by this script to effectively integrate and manage the database operations.
